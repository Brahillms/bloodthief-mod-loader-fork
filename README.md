## Get started making a map

To get started making a map, you'll have to start by setting up TrenchBroom.

- First, download the zip called `map_creation_files`.
- Then unzip it anywhere
- Then move the `Bloodthief.zip` file to the TrenchBroom game config folder 
    - Windows: C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\TrenchBroom\games
    - Linux: ~/.TrenchBroom/games
- Make sure the `Bloodthief` folder is inside the `games` folder
- Then open TrenchBroom, click new map, click open preferences, click Bloodthief, set the game path to the same path as where you moved the `Bloodthief.zip` file to.
- Create a map with Bloodthief

## How to load your map

From the original `map_creation_files`, move the `maps` folder into your Bloodthief game folder that Steam downloaded Bloodthief into.
- You should edit the json file in the `example_map` folder within the `maps` folder
- Make sure the json file has the same name as the map file
