# Mod loader for Bloodthief (Playtest)

Place `override.cfg` and `addons/` into your bloodthief directory, and it will scan the `mods-unpacked` directory to load mods

A mod is just a folder in that directory with a `mod_main.gd` file that has the method `init`

This is very rudimentary right now but will be developed further
